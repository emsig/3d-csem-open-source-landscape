Comparison
##########

The consent was that we should not compare a layered model, as we have done
that all independently in previous publications, see `Issue #4
<https://github.com/prisae/3d-csem-open-source-landscape/issues/4>`_

I (Dieter) suggest three models, but we can obviously still discuss that.

2. 3D marine block model (the SEG/EAGE salt model), where FD codes can shine.
3. Land model with topography, where FE codes can shine.


Simple block model
==================

Simple block (one to three blocks) model similar to [MQJM13]_; potentially with
a bit a funkier source (say, finite length rotated bipole and finite length
receivers). In this case I would only compare inline and crossline responses.


3D marine model
===============

SEG/EAGE salt model, with a complex subsurface. In this case we could compare
whole depth- or cross-sections.


3D land model
=============

Including pronounced topography but a simpler subsurface model.


Future (?)
==========

Comment KK: *One thing that the community could really use is more test models
for various scenarios, and having them be easily accessible.*

As we model anyway we could do this in this paper; we don't have to show them
in the paper, but can store them all in a repo where we will host the above
three examples anyway.
