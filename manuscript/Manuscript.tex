We will have to decide on a Journal. Current suggestions:\\
- GMD: Geoscientific Model Development\\
- SIG: Surveys in Geophysics\\
- SE: Solid Earth\\
- GJI: Geophysical Journal International\\
- GP: Geophysical Prospecting\\
- GEO: Geophysics\\
- CAG: Computers and Geosciences\\
\imycom[DW]{
I think \emph{Geoscientific Model Development} and \emph{Surveys in Geophysics}
were the favourite ones when we discussed it ones. I personally would be very
interested in GMD. What do you think? But also interesting would be the GJI,
because the MT comparison was published there, so it would be in the same
place. I just had a very bad experience with GP, so I am not inclined on that
at all.}
\imycom[RR]{GMD looks very interesting, my only concern is that it might not be
in the scope of EM modelers, but we can probably reach modeleres from other
communities as well.}
\imycom[OCR]{I also find GMD very interesting, in fact it was my first option to
publish the first petgem version (2 years ago). The answer was: "manuscript
outside of journal's scope". In this sense I agree with Raphael. My vote is for
SIG}
}
\imycom[LH]{SIG does look like a good option. Given the spirit of the paper, it
would be nice to publish it open-access. Does anyone have a sense of how much that
costs with SIG? I could likely get partial funding towards this. Solid Earth
might be a nice option in that case because it is open-access by default. }

\section{Introduction}

\imycom[RR]{We need to take care to not mix British English with AE, I'm very
  used to AE, but Dieter started with (at least what I can identify) mainly BE,
  so I tried to follow (mainly s instead of z and ou instead of o in some
  words). I hope there are not too many inconsistencies, as probably Lindsey
  has to fix all these mistakes in the end:-)
\imycom[DW]{Be aware of Canadian English and Australian English :-D -- You are
  of course right. I am usually mostly BE, having done my PhD in Scotland.
  However, I don't think it matters at the moment, because it will depend to
  what journal we submit. With an appropriate spellchecker that should be a
  quick thing then.}}
\imycom[LH]{It's true! Canadian English ends up being an interesting hybrid(!)}

\imycom[OCR]{In general, I believe that the content is adequate and the ideas
are clear and in accordance with the objective that we have initially set.
However, I want to highlight the task of being careful when justifying the
absence of the SimPEG results for the Marlim model (I have read it in Slack,
although it may not be definitive). I believe that this may or may not be a
weak point depending on how we explain it. I know that perhaps it is not
serious, I only make this comment so that the speech justifies the facts. }

Controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) measurements are a frequently applied
method in various geophysical exploration fields, such as geothermal,
groundwater, oil and gas, mining, civil engineering, or geo-hazards. Modelling
these electromagnetic fields is therefore of great interest to design survey
layouts, to understand the measured data, and for inversion purposes.
Publications regarding 3D modelling in electromagnetic methods started to
appear as early as the 1970's and 1980's. These early publications were
integral equation (IE) methods, having an anomaly embedded within a layered
medium, mostly for loop-loop type transient EM measurements
\citep{GJI.74.Raiche, GEO.75.Hohmann, GJI.82.Das, GEO.86.Newman} and
magnetotelluric (MT) measurements \citep{GEO.84.Wannamaker}. \cite{Ward1988}
assemble many of these solutions in ``Electromagnetic Theory for Geophysical
Applications,'' which is widely viewed as an authoritative publication on
electromagnetic geophysics.

In the 1990's, computer became sufficiently powerful that 3D modelling gained
traction, which resulted amongst other publications in the book
\emph{Three-Dimensional Electromagnetics} by the SEG
\citep{B.SEG.99.Oristaglio}. Often cited publications from that time are
\cite{RSC.94.Mackie}, 3D MT computation; \cite{RS.94.Druskin}, frequency- and
time-domain modelling using a Yee grid and a global Krylov subspace
approximation; and \cite{RS.96.Alumbaugh, GJI.97.Newman}, low-to-high frequency
computation on massively parallel computers.

\imycom[LH]{I added a couple citations here - I think the Haber 2001 is important to include in the FV list (if we want to remove the 2007 one to reduce duplicating authors, I think that is okay as we cite it later)}

The continuous improvement of computing power and the CSEM boom in the early
2000's in the hydrocarbon industry led to a wealth of developed numerical
solutions and according publications. The most common applied methods to solve
Maxwell's equation are the IE method \citep{GJI.74.Raiche, RS.02.Hursan,
GEO.06.Zhdanov, GP.10.Tehrani, CAG.16.Kruglyakov, MGS.17.Kruglyakov} and
different variations of the differential equation (DE) method, such as finite
differences (FD) \citep{IEEE.66.Yee, GEO.93.Wang, RSC.94.Mackie, RS.94.Druskin,
GEO.09.Streich, CAG.13.Sommer}, finite elements (FE) \citep{GEO.04.Commer,
GJI.11.Schwarzbach,GEO.12.daSilva, GJI.13.Grayver, GJI.13.Puzyrev,
SEG.16.Zhang}, and finite volumes (FV) \citep{EM.90.Madsen, Haber2001,PIER.01.Clemens,
GP.06.Mulder, ECP.07.Haber, GEO.14.Jahandari}. There are also many different
types of discretisation, where the most common ones are regular grids
(cartesian, rectilinear), mostly using a Yee grid \citep{IEEE.66.Yee} or a
Lebedev grid \citep{CMMP.64.Lebedev}, but also unstructured tetrahedral grids
\citep{SEG.16.Zhang, CAG.17.Cai}, hexagonal meshes \citep{CAG.14.Cai}, or
OcTree meshes \citep{ECP.07.Haber}. Very well written overviews about the
different approaches to 3D EM modelling are given by \cite{SG.05.Avdeev} and
\cite{SG.10.Borner}.

In the last 15 years, the publications with regards to 3D EM modelling grew
tremendously, driven by the ever increasing computing power. One reason why
there are so many reports about this topic results from the variety of solution
techniques for the systems of linear equations (SLE). They can be distinguished
between direct solvers \citep{GEO.09.Streich, GP.14.Chung, GEO.14.Jaysaval,
GEO.15.Grayver, SEG.15.Oh, GJI.18.Wang}, indirect solvers \citep{GP.06.Mulder,
GJI.15.Jaysaval}, or a combination of both, so-called hybrid solvers
\citep{GEO.18.Liu}. The solvers often use preconditioners such as the multigrid
method \citep{SIAM.02.Aruliah, GP.06.Mulder, GJI.16.Jaysaval}.

\imycom[LH]{Here, I think that there
is a point to make about duplication of efforts vs. new methodologies. Often
the development of a new methodology requires that a new implementation be
built from scratch. As a field though, we have matured to a point where we
know what the methods / approaches are, and much of the next stage of
advancements will be more incremental. (We argued this in Oldenburg et al,
2019 - so to self-cite ;) (doi: https://doi.org/10.1080/08123985.2019.1580118,
arxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08245.pdf). See what you think of the
following framing for the next paragraph - we can discuss:

Many of the advancements made in the EM modelling community over the past
decades have required that authors develop new implementation from scratch.
These codes often provided the research group or company with a competitive
advantage for a time, and thus the source codes were often kept internal. In
some cases, executables have been made available for academic purposes upon
request or to sponsoring consortium members. As the field continues to mature,
advancements become more incremental, and particularly in an applied field,
many advancements are driven by new use-cases and applications that were not
considered by the original authors. In his review on EM modelling and
inversion \cite{SG.05.Avdeev} concludes with the
following statement: «\emph{The most important challenge that faces the EM
community today is to convince software developers to put their 3-D EM forward
and inverse solutions into the public domain, at least after some time. This
would have a strong impact on the whole subject and the developers would
benefit from feedback regarding the real needs of the end-users.}» Further,
\cite{Oldenburg2019} argue that an open-source paradigm has the potential to
accelerate multidisciplinary research by encouraging the development of
modular, interoperable tools that are supported by a community of researchers.
}

Probably the main reason for the numerous amount of code developments was
outlined by \cite{SG.05.Avdeev}, who finished his review with the
following statement: «\emph{The most important challenge that faces the EM
community today is to convince software developers to put their 3-D EM forward
and inverse solutions into the public domain, at least after some time. This
would have a strong impact on the whole subject and the developers would
benefit from feedback regarding the real needs of the end-users.}» Some major
exploration service companies, as well as certain research consortia and
research groups, have their own 3D CSEM codes, but how about codes that are
open-source? Academic codes were traditionally often available upon request by
authors. Codes distributed that way are often provided with the request that users not
share the code, and they often come without a license attached which means that
they are, legally, not open-source. Also, at times there can be significant
hurdles to install a code.

\imycom[LH]{Here, I think it is worth discussing the distinction between
open-source: source code available + openly licensed (with an Open Source
Initiative (OSI, https://opensource.org) approved license), open-development:
code is versioned, development and issue tracking happens publicly (e.g. on
GitHub or similar), and open communities: actively soliciting contributions
and pull requests which change the code. and then the push towards open
development / open communities motivates best practices including continuous
integration, documentation, etc. See what you think of my suggested adaptation
below. There might be a few citations we can add for an open model of development / open community project. I will do some digging. Again, happy to discuss.

In many domains of science, it is becoming more common for researchers to
release source-code with an open license that allows use and modification (
e.g. see the Open Source Initiative approved licenses:
\href{https://opensource.org/licenses}{https://opensource.org/licenses}). This
is an important step for improving reproducibility of research: «\emph{to
provide the means by which the reader can verify the validity of the results
and make use of them in further research}» \citep{GEO.17.Broggini}. Going a
step beyond releasing open-source software, many groups adopt an open model of
development where code is hosted and versioned in an online repository,
all changes are public, and users can engage by submitting and track issues.
Community oriented projects further engagement by encouraging pull-requests,
which are suggested changes to the code. Successful, well-maintained projects
often have unit-testing and continuous integration that runs those tests with
any changes to the code. Additionally, documentation that includes examples
and tutorials is an important component for on-boarding new users and
contributors. As a result, in many areas of the geosciences, we are seeing a
shift away from a one-way distribution of code towards building global
communities around open projects. Related projects within the
realm of geophysical exploration are e.g., \texttt{pyGIMLi}
\citep{CAG.17.Rucker} or \texttt{Fatiando} \citep{JOSS.18.Uieda}
}

The meaning of the term open-source evolved rapidly in the last two decades.
Today, open-source generally not only means that a code is available (with a
proper license), but also that the code is hosted online, is under version
control, has the possibility to file issues and make pull requests to fix bugs.
These are important requirements for reproducible research «\emph{to provide
the means by which the reader can verify the validity of the results and make
use of them in further research}» \citep{GEO.17.Broggini}. Well maintained
codes often have continuous integration that includes testing of the code base
and online hosted documentation, often including examples and tutorials. As
such, the term has shifted from purely open-source codes to developments in the
open with increasingly building a global community. Related projects within the
realm of geophysical exploration are e.g., \texttt{pyGIMLi}
\citep{CAG.17.Rucker} or \texttt{Fatiando} \citep{JOSS.18.Uieda}.

}

In this paper, we discuss the topic of open-source developments with respect to 3D
CSEM modeling. Even though it comprises still the minority of developments, the
landscape in this field of research changed in the last five years. Previously,
there were only closed-source codes owned by companies or  consortia and
individual projects, often without proper documentation, that could be
requested from the authors. We introduce and compare four recent open-source
projects with focus on 3D CSEM modeling. All presented codes are in the Python
ecosystem and use either the FV method on structured grids or the FE method on
unstructured tetrahedral meshes.

Furthermore, we deal with the topic of verification. \cite{GJI.13.Miensopust}
presents a review of two workshops dealing with the verification of
magnetotelluric forward and inversion codes, but we are not aware of any
comparable study or benchmark suite for CSEM data. Hence, we first conduct a
similar exercise for CSEM codes. We want our efforts to help to ensure the
reliability of simulations, not only carried out with the available open-source
codes, but also for individual closed-source projects. Analytical and
semi-analytical solutions only exist for simple halfspace or layered-Earth
models, which served mostly to verify new codes. Beyond these simple models, the only
objective possibility to ensure the accuracy of solutions is by comparing
results from different modellers. If different discretisations and
implementations of Maxwell's equations yield the same result, it gives
confidence in their accuracy.

We simulate EM fields for a layered background model with vertical transverse
isotropy, containing three blocks, as well as for the complex marine Marlim R3D model.
These two model designs as well as the corresponding results from four
different codes provide a benchmark for new codes to be compared to and
validated with. In the following section, we introduce the codes under
consideration. Afterwards, we present the considered benchmark cases in detail
and present the modeling results of our four codes in terms of accuracy and
computational performance. Beyond that, we extensively discuss important points
that control the performance and suitability of our FV and FE codes, including
mainly considerations about the mesh design and the choice of solvers. We
conclude with a summary of our results and a motivation for the EM community to
not only continue to extend the landscape of open-source codes but to also
create a landscape of open-source benchmark models.

\imycom[RR]{Regarding
  \todo[inline, color=white]{
  "It is worth mentioning that there are many more 3D EM
  codes developed in other fields than geophysics such as communication systems
  (antennas, radar, satellites), medical imaging, or civil engineering. There
  are various open-source codes in these fields too, e.g., Elmer
  (\href{http://www.csc.fi/elmer}{csc.fi/elmer}, couldn't
  find a publication, just a poster).
  \todo[inline, color=gray]{(\textbf{[DW]}: Add 2-3 proper references)}
  While these codes could potentially be used for the same goals as presented
  here we restrict our review to codes purpose-built and ready without further
  adjustments for geophysical applications."
}
  I thought a lot about this but I just think the previous paragraph is not
  required in our introduction and haven't find a location where it fits
  considering different logical structures. I think it is also not important
  for this paper to tell "that there are more codes in EM than only
  geophysics", that's quite obvious. Maybe delete or shorten to 1 sentences to
  add Elmer and place this sentence somewhere else? I think, an appropriate
  list of all non-geophysical open-source EM codes should be very long anyway,
  we just don't know them or at least I'm not familiar with them.}


\imycom[LH]{Just a thought, but right now we don't state Maxwell's equations anywhere! That seems like something we should do :) That also provides an easy space for talking about Fourier Transform conventions and such too.

% Following the conventions of Ward and Hohmann \cite{Ward1988}, the quasi-static Maxwell's equations are

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{split}
%     \nabla \times \vec{E} &= -i \omega\vec{B}  \\
%     \nabla \times \vec{H} &= \vec{J}
% \end{split}
% \label{eq:maxwell_freq_quasi}
% \end{equation}

\section{Codes}

\imycom[RR]{I think we should introduce the term degrees of freedom (dof),
  equivalent to the size of the SLE, as general measure of our problem sizes.
  If it is somewhat x*Nedges, or related to Ncells or Nnodes, who cares? We
  just need this one number for this paper in my opinion, more details in the
  jupyter notebooks - fine.}

The four codes under consideration are, in alphabetical order, \custem
\citep{GEO.19.Rochlitz}, \emg3d \citep{JOSS.19.Werthmuller}, \petgem
\citep{CAG.18.CastilloReyes, GJI.19.CastilloReyes}, and \simpeg
\citep{CAG.15.Cockett, Heagy2017}. All four codes have their user-facing routines written
in Python; all of them make heavy use of \texttt{NumPy}
\citep{CSE.11.VanDerWalt} and \texttt{SciPy} \citep{NM.20.Virtanen}. The four
of them are “modern” open-source projects, meaning that they come with both, an
open-source license and an online-hosted version-control system with tracking
possibilities (raising issues, filing pull requests). All developments comprise
an extensive online documentation with many examples and have continuous
integration to some degree. Newer package-management systems such as Conda,
Docker, or pip significantly supported us to make our codes easily available
and installable without any user-side compilations. Each one can be downloaded
and installed with a single command.

In the following, we provide a quick overview of the codes. It is, however, beyond the scope
of this article to go into every detail of the different modellers, and we
refer to their documentations for more details. An overview comparison of the
different codes is given in Table~\ref{tbl:codecomparison}. All codes have in
common that they solve the\mycom[DW]{are we all using the weak form?}\mycom[LH]{SimPEG uses weak form} weak

\subsection{custEM}

The customisable electromagnetic modeling Python toolbox custEM was developed
for simulating arbitrary complex 3D CSEM geometries with focus on semi-airborne
setups, but it supports also land-based, airborne, coastal  or marine
environments. Multiple electric or magnetic field or potential finite-element
approaches were implemented as total or secondary field formulations. The
finite-element kernel, including higher order basis functions and
parallelisation, relies on the FEniCS project \citep{B.SPR.12.Logg,
B.SPR.16.Langtangen}. The resulting systems of linear equations are solved with
MUMPS \citep{SIAM.01.Amestoy}, which is a very robust but memory consuming
choice. Primary field solutions are supplied by the COMET \citep{GEO.20.Skibbe}
package.

The toolbox considers generally anisotropic petrophysical properties. Even
though changes of the conductivity is mainly of interest for CSEM modeling, the
electric permittivity and magnetic permeability can be taken into account using
the preferred electric field approach on Nédélec elements. Recently, induced
polarization parameters in frequency-domain and three methods for simulating
time-domain responses were added to custEM. The provided meshing tools based on
TetGen \citep{TOM.15.Si} and functionalities of pyGIMLi \citep{CAG.17.Rucker}
facilitate the generation of tetrahedral meshes including layered-earth
geometries with topography or bathymetry and anomalous bodies which are allowed
to be connected or to reach the surface.

The custEM toolbox is under steady development and maintenance. Future
enhancements comprise adding iterative solution techniques, provided by FEniCS,
as well as further functionalities for automatically incorporating intersecting
bodies such as folds or faults in meshes. Furthermore, current work is on using
custEM for inverse modeling applications.


\subsection{emg3d}

The 3D CSEM modeller \emg3d is a multigrid \citep{CMMP.64.Fedorenko} solver for
3D electromagnetic diffusion following \cite{GP.06.Mulder}, with tri-axial
electrical anisotropy, isotropic electric permittivity, and isotropic magnetic
permeability. The matrix-free solver can be used as main solver or as
preconditioner for one of the Krylov subspace methods implemented in SciPy, and
the governing equations are discretized on a staggered grid by the
finite-integration technique \citep{AEU.77.Weiland}, which is a finite-volume
generalization of a Yee grid. The code is written completely in Python using
the NumPy and SciPy stacks, where the most time- and memory-consuming parts are
sped up through jitted (just-in-time compiled) functions using Numba
\citep{LLVM.15.Lam}. The code computes the electric field due to an electric
source in the frequency-domain, which is its main application (frequency-domain
CSEM). However, there are also routines to obtain the magnetic field due to an
electric source, to obtain the electric and magnetic fields due to a magnetic
source, and to obtain time-domain responses.

The multigrid method is characterized by almost linear scaling both in terms of
runtime (CPU) and memory (RAM) usage, and it is therefore a comparably
low-memory consumption solver. It is also minimal in terms of requirements,
only NumPy, SciPy, and Numba are required, with Python 3.7+. The current
development is focused on adding basic inversion capabilities, and a further
plan is to implement a hook in order to use \emg3d as a frequency-domain CSEM
solver within the grander \simpeg framework.

\subsection{PETGEM}

\petgem is a parallel code for frequency-domain 3D CSEM data from marine and
land surveys. The high-order edge FE method (HEFEM) is used for the
discretization of the governing equations in its diffusive form. This technique
provides a suitable mechanism to obtain stable numerical solutions as well as a
good trade-off between number of dof\mycom[OCR]{I assume we have previously
mentioned the term dofs} and computational effort. The current implementation
supports up to six-order tetrahedral vector basis functions. Moreover, because
the HEFEM belongs to the FE family, the unstructured meshes can be used
efficiently on complex geometries (e.g., models with topography and
bathymetry).

\petgem permits to locate the source and receivers anywhere in the
computational domain\mycom[DW]{I think this applies to all four codes} (e.g.,
sediments, seafloor, sea, ground), allowing to analyze the physical environment
of the electric responses and how parameters impact them (e.g., frequency,
conductivity, dependence on mesh setup, basis order, solver type, among
others). Furthermore, \petgem implements a semi-adaptive mesh strategy ($hp$
mesh refinement) based on physical parameters and on polynomial order to
satisfy quality criteria chosen by the user. Nonetheless, only Horizontal
Electric Dipole (HED) has been implemented.

For the parallel forward modelling computations, a highly scalable MPI domain
decomposition allows reducing run-times and the solution of large-scale
modelling cases. This strategy is capable of exploiting the parallelism offered
by both modest multi-core computers and cutting-edge clusters (e.g.,
High-performance Computing architectures).

Based on the current state of the \petgem project, there are many possibilities
to improve or to add additional features. For instance, in the short-term, more
modeling routines and support for multi-source set-ups will be implemented. For
the long-term, the obvious next step is to move to 3D CSEM data inversion.

\subsection{SimPEG}

\simpeg is a modular toolbox for simulations and gradient based inversions in
geophysics. Current functionality includes modelling and inversion
capabilities for gravity, magnetics, direct current resistivity, induced
polarization, electromagnetics (time, frequency, as well as natural sources,
e.g. magnetotellurics), and fluid flow (Richards equation). It is a community
driven project that aims to support researchers by providing a flexible,
extensible framework and to facilitate integration of data sets from a variety
of geophysical methods, including joint inversions \citep{Astic2020}, by
providing a common interface to each method.

Meshes and finite volume differential operators are implemented in the
\texttt{discretize} package. It currently includes tensor, OcTree,
cylindrical, and logically rectangular meshes. Each mesh type inherits from a
common structure and uses the same naming conventions for methods and
properties. This allows us to decouple the implementation of a discretized
partial differential equation from the details of the mesh geometry and
therefore we can write a single implementation of discretized partial
differential equation (or set of partial differential equations) in \simpeg
that will support all mesh types implemented in \texttt{discretize}.

The electromagnetics implementations use a staggered grid finite volume
approach where physical properties are discretized at cell centers, fields on
cell edges and fluxes on cell faces \citep{IEEE.66.Yee} (for an overview of
discretizing Maxwell's equations, we recommend \cite{Haber2014b}). There are
two different discretization strategies implemented for Maxwell's equations: (
a) the EB-formulation, which discretizes the electric field ($\vec{e}$) on
cell edges and the magnetic flux density ($\vec{h}$) on cell faces, and (b)
the HJ-formulation, which discretizes the magnetic field ($\vec{h}$) on cell
edges and the current density ($\vec{j}$) on cell faces. In both cases the
physical properties: electrical conductivity / resistivity and magnetic
permeability are discretized at cell centers. Having multiple implementations
allows for testing that compares results from each approach, as well as the
representation of both electrical and magnetic sources on cylindrically
symmetric meshes. \simpeg supports variable magnetic permeability and
full-tensor anisotropy for the physical properties.

% Support for domain decomposition approaches (see for example \cite{Fournier2020})

\simpeg interfaces to various solvers including \texttt{PARDISO} \citep{FGCS.04.Schenk}, \texttt{MUMPS} \citep{SIAM.01.Amestoy}, as well as those implemented in the \texttt{scipy.sparse.linalg} module \citep{NM.20.Virtanen}. For problems with many sources (and reciprocity is not a natural solution, e.g. in 3D airborne EM), \simpeg contains machinery for domain-decomposition approaches; see for example \cite{Fournier2020}.

\section{Numerical Verifications}

We computed the responses for two different models to verify that all different
3D codes yield the same electromagnetic responses. The first simple \emph{Block
model} consists of a layered, anisotropic background with three embedded
blocks. The second Marlim R3D model is based on a very complex, realistic
marine CSEM setup.

\subsection{Block Model}

The block model is a derivation of the \emph{Dublin Test Model 1} from the
first EM modeling workshop described by \cite{GJI.13.Miensopust}. We took the
same layout of the blocks but adjusted the dimensions and resistivities to a
typical marine CSEM problem, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:block-model}. We
additionally added a layered background with vertical transverse isotropy
(VTI).
%
\plot*{block-model}{width=.6\textwidth}{
  Sketch of the block model. The layered model consists of an air layer, a
  water layer, a thin top-layer followed by a thick, anisotropic background
  layer, and at the bottom a resistive basement layer. All three blocks are
  embedded in the thick background layer, which has VTI with
  $\lambda=\sqrt{2}$.
}
%

The layered model consists of an upper halfspace of air, a 600\,m deep water
layer, followed by a 150\,m thick, isotropic layer of 1\,\ohmm, a 3.3\,km
thick, anisotropic layer of $\rho_\text{h}=2\,\ohmm$ and
$\rho_\text{v}=4\,\ohmm$, and finally a resistive basement consisting of a
lower halfspace of $1000\,\ohmm$. The 200\,m long, $x$-directed source is
located 50\,m above the seafloor from $x=-50$ to $x=50\,$m in $x$-direction, at
$y=0\,$m. The $x$-directed receivers are placed on the seafloor every 200\,m
from $x=-10\,$km to $x=+10\,$km in three lines for $y=-3, 0, 3\,$km.

The thin isotropic layer beneath the water requires many tetrahedra for a
good-quality discretisation. Therefore, the FE codes \custem and \petgem used
the same tetrahedral mesh with a horizontal layered-earth extent of 30\,km from
the origin, surrounded by a ten times larger halfspace-like boundary mesh with
water conductivities assigned to the subsurface. This approximation
significantly reduced the problem size compared to considering the
layered-earth geometry for the whole computational domain. \imycom[RR]{Add
short information about mesh design with SIMPEG and emg3d, including something
like "comparatively coarse discretization in center to minimize computation
times" }

In a first step, we compare the layered background to the semi-analytical
solutions of a 1D code, for which we use  \empymod\citep{GEO.17.Werthmuller}.
Figures~\ref{fig:results-layered-0} and \ref{fig:results-layered--3} show the
actual responses in the top rows, and the relative error in the bottom rows for
the receiver lines $y=0\,$km and $y=\pm3\,$km, which are identical.

Figure~\ref{fig:results-layered-0} illustrates the inline responses in the
top-row for offsets $r>0.5\,$km. We only show the semi-analytical result for
the real and imaginary amplitudes. The bottom row displays the relative error
of the 3D codes. The results show that all codes are yielding accurate result
with errors of around 1\,\% in most parts and overall below a few percent,
disregarding locations affected by sign reversals. The differences can be
mainly attributed to the chosen discretisations. The FE codes show the
strongest misfits at large offsets, most likely caused by the utilized boundary
mesh. Very low errors at large offsets are achieved by \emg3d, whereas it
suffers at short offsets from a coarse grid.

In a second step, three resistive blocks were added in the 3.3\,km-thick,
anisotropic background layer as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:block-model}. They
have resistivities of $\rho=10\,\ohmm$ (shallow beam perpendicular to survey
lines), $\rho=100\,\ohmm$ (thin plate, South-East), and $\rho=500\,\ohmm$
(cube, North-West). As there are no analytical solutions for this model we show
the normalized difference between different codes, instead of the relative
error, where the normalized difference of two responses $p$ and $q$ is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \mr{NRMSD~(\%)} = 200 \frac{|p - q|}{|p| + |q|}\ .
  \label{eq:nrmsd}
\end{equation}
%
\imycom[DW]{NRMSD: Comparing all codes to all would make the figures too
cluttered, and I don't think it would add a lot insights. My idea is therefore
to compare \emg3d/\simpeg (the two FV ones), \custem/\petgem (the two FE ones),
and \emg3d/\custem (a cross-comparison). What do you think?

\imycom[RR]{Agreed. Another suggestion, I solved this visualization problem

  upper triangles, or we show absolute magnitudes for layered earth in lower
  triangle and for block model in upper triangle. With help of this plot, one
  could easily say if differences are higher for block model and which codes
  fit to each other well.}
\imycom[RR]{If using the mentioned matrix plots, we would need only one of the
  figures 4-6, and could show the other data comprehensively. I added a python

The results for the three receiver lines $y=-3,0,3\,$km are shown in

\ref{fig:results-block-3}, respectively, and the corresponding CPU and RAM in

The difference becomes only significant at offsets larger than 8\,km. This is
due to a practical difference in the meshing: This simple block model is
advantageous for FV codes, as it consists of rectangular blocks and horizontal
layers, simple geometric objects. While having a very thin, shallow layer is
straight-forward for FV codes, it requires many cells for a FE code, and
a similar approach as for the Block Model was used. This is the reason for the
increased NRMSD at large offsets, and it has nothing to do with the accuracy of
the computation itself.

\subsection{Marlim R3D}

The Marlim oil field is a giant reservoir in a turbidite sandstone horizon in
the north-eastern part of the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, which was
discovered in 1985. \cite{BJG.17.Carvalho} created from seismic data and well
log data a realistic resistivity model with vertical transverse isotropy (VTI),
Marlim R3D (MR3D), which they released under an open-source license.
\cite{GEO.19.Correa} computed CSEM data for six frequencies from 0.125\,Hz to
1.25\,Hz, released under an open-source license. To compute the data they used
a state-of-the-art code from the industry \citep{GEO.07.Maao}. It is therefore
an ideal case to verify our open-source codes against, as it is a complex,
realistic model and the data were computed by an industry-proofed code.
Additionally, that code is a time-domain code, whereas the four codes under
consideration here compute the results all in the frequency-domain.
\imycom[RR]{I would delete this sentence, not that important and a bit
  redundant.
\imycom[DW]{Did you refer to the last sentence or the one before? I think the
  last sentence contains quite important info.}
\imycom[OCR]{If possible, I would like to uphold this sentence. I agree with
  Dieter, it contains relevant information.}
}

The detailed reservoir model consists of $1022 \times 371 \times 1229$ cells,
totalling to almost 466 million cells, where each cell has dimensions of 25 by
75 by 5\,m. For the computation the model is upscaled to 515 by 563 by 310
cells, totalling to almost 90 million cells, where each cell has dimensions of
100 by 100 by 20\,m.

The published data set consists of a regular grid of receivers of 20 in eastern
direction by 25 in northern direction, 500 receivers in total, with 1\,km
spacing located on the irregular seafloor. 45 source-towlines were located on
the same grid, 50\,m above the seafloor, with shots every 100\,m. In
\cite{GEO.19.Correa} the actual responses for one receiver with the
corresponding East-West inline and one East-West broadside acquisition line are
shown, which is the data we chose for our comparison. The cross-section of the
resistivity model along the chosen inline acquisition line is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:model-marlim}, together with the acquisition information.


%
\plot*{model-marlim}{width=\textwidth}{
  This figure obviously needs to be improved massively (at least a colorbar).

We computed all all six frequencies for all components ($E_x$, $E_y$, $E_z$)
for both inline and broadside acquisition lines. However, we show here only the

broadside. The comparison is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:results-marlim}.

Even if modeling results may look completely valid, they could not be correct
at all. Verifying the performance of 3D CSEM codes for real 3D problems is only
possible by cross-validating multiple solutions. Overall, we observed an
excellent match between all solutions. The relative misfits, almost always
smaller than 10\,\%, were related to the either weak or strong amplitudes of
real or imaginary parts and can be attributed to particularities regarding the
discretization, boundary effects, and interpolation. Considering this
satisfactory result in terms of accuracy and robustness, it is more interesting
to discuss the characteristics of the four considered codes with focus on the
demand of computational resources and the capability of handling the
investigated CSEM geometries, including the very important underlying mesh
design. The following arguments are based on a comparison of only marine CSEM
models, which are the focus of industry applications. Nevertheless, we are
confident that many observations would hold in a similar manner for land-based,
airborne, or mixed setups.

We point out that making a synthetic and a real benchmark model available to
cross-validate any 3D CSEM code was the determining reason for their choice,
regardless of the suitability of the considered FD and FE codes for these
problems. The first model, including the block-anomalies variation, is exactly
reproducible by using any numerical method with either regular or irregular
computational domains. Aside from the idea of analyzing an industrially
relevant benchmark example, the Marlim R3D model was also considered since the
primary design from \cite{GEO.19.Correa} uses a regular discretisation. At
least theoretically, the exact geometry might be reconstructed with
unstructured meshes, but it is never possible to convert an irregular geometry
to a regular grid without approximations. Hence, the chosen examples favoured
the FD codes, since they used either regular grids or
octree-meshes, whereas the two FE codes were required to
tetrahedralise the model geometries.

In the first model, the necessity of discretising regular structures with
tetrahedra, especially thin layers, led to comparatively large FE problem sizes
and computational resource demands. FE codes with unstructured meshes were
probably the poorest choice of all commonly used methods for this setup in
terms of computational performance. However, thinking about introducing just
one slight irregularity such as bathymetry, a thin dipping plate or an
anticline, the performance behaviour could likely switch. All of these changes
would barely change the problem size for the FE codes, but significantly
increase it for the FD codes if the true geometry should be approximated
sufficiently accurate.

The real Marlim R3D model was, ironically, the ideal case for FE codes because
it's structure was characterized by irregular lithological horizons obtained
from seismic data. Since the corresponding published resistivity model was
defined on a regular grid, we were forced to approximate the comparatively fine
regular discretization by an unstructured one and interpolate the resistivity
data for being able to apply the FE codes to this problem. We are completely
aware about the ineptness of this re-approximation procedure, unless it served
for the cross-validation purposes. Nevertheless, the chosen tetrahedral
discretization, especially in combination with second order basis functions,
showed clearly the intrinsic strength of the FE codes, requiring significantly
less dof for meshing irregular geometries in general. The p2 FE solution
required only $\approx$9\,M dof instead of $\approx$90\,M dof for the FD system
by \citet{GEO.19.Correa}, disregarding the structure of the system matrices.

The codes under consideration use direct and indirect solvers. In general, the
biggest advantage of iterative solvers with appropriate preconditioners are the
comparatively small memory requirements. Direct solvers can be considered as
most robust to solve any ill-conditioned SLE, which is most important for
systems of the FE method on unstructured meshes. As the consumed computational
resources indicate, a more powerful machine than a laptop is required for most
3D CSEM problems, but no high-performance-computing architecture.

The computation times can differ significantly for specific simulations, but
there is no clear general advantage for one of the solver types. In our models,
the runtime comparison favoured the iterative solver and therefore, \emg3d.
Even though not shown here, direct solvers exhibit their strongest advantage in
terms of computation times if responses of multiple CSEM transmitters need to
be calculated in the same computational domain. As the system matrix
factorisation requires 98-99\,\% of the solution time, computations for
additional sources come at almost no cost for direct solvers, i.e., MUMPS,
whereas it would come at the same cost as the first source for \emg3d. For the
sake of completeness, note that there are also advanced techniques for
iterative solvers to make use of preconditioners, factorisations, or
intermediate solutions of the previous SLE to speed up the calculation for
multiple sources, but this argumentation is beyond the scope of this work.

We see this work as the start for future elaboration on the validation of
modeling codes, not necessarily restricted to CSEM problems. Much more
comparisons and examples are required which not only result in the finding that
a sufficient accuracy was observed. 3D CSEM modelling is a difficult task,
which requires many considerations. It starts with the selection of the right
code for the problem. We found that the meshing task, which is most performance
determining, is particularly difficult and relevant, choosing cells small
enough to appropriately represent the model yet to be as coarse as possible
still achieving the desired precision. The required model extent has to be
considered as well, thinking also about effects of the so-called airwave in
marine setups or boundary meshes in general. This is not a new finding but
rather well known fact. We are surprised that only the minority of publications
in the field of 3D EM modeling considers a sufficiently detailed elaboration of
the meshing process.

A completely objective evaluation of codes is only possible by
cross-validation. Nevertheless, we point out that using different
discretizations or formulations of the numerical approach, e.g. by choosing
field or potential approaches, second or total field formulations, different
polynomial order basis functions, and others, is a suitable alternative to the
cross-comparison of multiple codes for self-validating complex 3D results. This
is a very powerful method to confirm the general functionality of codes for any
modeling problem, which might not be covered by existing cross-validation
benchmark examples. Considering for instance  this study, it would be very
optimistic to estimate the accuracy of the utilized codes for a land-based
mineral exploration setup with a highly-conductive, steeply-dipping conductor.
However, each modeller could run multiple simulations with different
configurations to increase the reliability of the obtained results.

\imycom[DW]{I would like to capture as many as possible of the (I) differences,
  (II) difficulties, (III) advantages, and (IV) disadvantages, that we
  encountered in this exercise. This includes differences from direct to
  iterative solver and differences from FE to FD codes etc. Please just jot
  down things that come to your mind.
\imycom[OCR]{I think an important point is the user experience (modeler). I
  know this is an intangible element but perhaps we could add a line about it.

\imycom[DW]{Maybe we should create a Google-Doc for working on the Conclusions
collaboratively at the same time?}

\imycom[DW]{I obviously haven't really done this section, just af few thoughts
  that I noted over time. I think the discussion (as the abstract) has to be
tackled once the rest is at least in a draft status and all data is ready.}

\imycom[RR]{I also rearranged some of your thoughts and formulated mine. I
  moved some of them (the few sentences that were rather redundant motivation

We compared four different open-source 3D CSEM modellers by computing responses
for a layered, anisotropic model, including a modification with three resistive
blocks, and the realistic marine Marlim R3D model. All comparisons exhibited an
excellent reliability of the solutions. Our data should make it very easy for
new codes to have a readily available data set to test against and verify. We
are confident that the discussions about runtimes, memory consumptions, solver
choices, and, most important, discretisations of the 3D CSEM problems help
potential users not only to decide which modeller is best suited for specific
tasks, but also to support their individual projects.

As none of the considered methods is best suited for all problems, it is
important to have more test models for various scenarios in future. Our study
is limited to marine CSEM cases in the frequency-domain. Reasonable extensions
include providing benchmark models for land, airborne, or mixed CSEM
environments as well as time-domain data. Another addition to this work would
be focusing on complex irregular  models, tailored for an FE or FV code based
on unstructured meshes, and to compare how the FD codes can cope with it.

We encourage the community to not only work on new open-source code
developments but also to create a landscape of easily accessible benchmark
models for increasing the number of reliable and reproducible solutions. Our
study could provide one of the primary inputs for this task. We are confident
that the mentioned development will and should be taking place, taking into
account the current general trend in science to open-source papers, codes or
data.
