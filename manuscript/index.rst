Journal
-------

We will have to decide on a Journal. Current suggestions:

- GMD: Geoscientific Model Development
- SIG: Surveys in Geophysics
- SE: Solid Earth
- GJI: Geophysical Journal International
- GP: Geophysical Prospecting
- GEO: Geophysics
- CAG: Computers and Geosciences

I think *Geoscientific Model Development* and *Surveys in Geophysics* are the
favoured currently. I personally would be very interested in GMD. What do you
think? Also interesting would be the GJI, because the MT comparison was
published there, so it would be in the same place.
