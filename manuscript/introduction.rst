Introduction

*Just a list of ideas and notes so far.*

List codes, particularly papers presented that are, potentially, available or
not, but only by contacting the author. Mention change in coding practices,
development in the open, collaboration, bug reports, better documentation and
testing, etc. Example: [CHLE17]_ (open or not?)

Mention [MQJM13]_, which is a similar thing, but for 3D modelling and inversion
for MT.

Common features of our codes (probably with the exception of MARE3DEM) is:

- Not just open source, but also developed in the open and increasingly
  building a global community - also mention other projects as, e.g., pyGIMLi
  [RuGW17]_ and Fatiando (e.g., [Uied18]_).
- All codes we compare work in the Python eco-system (hard work underlying the
  Python API can differ though).
- Also modern dev, which includes CI testing, good documentation, issue
  tracking, and extensive discussion through Slack, Gitter, or similar, with
  dozens to hundreds of members (SimPEG 09-09-2019: 189 members), which
  constitutes a vibrant community and combines a huge spectrum from coders to
  first time users, and from academia to industr.

It is worth mentioning that there are many more open-source 3D electromagnetic
codes developed in other fields than geophysics. Examples include ... (TODO:
add at least three references). While these codes could potentially be used for
the same goals as presented here we restrict our review to codes purpose-built
for geophysical applications.
