Conclusions
###########

The landscape in 3D CSEM modelling greatly changed in the last five years or
so. While before there were only closed-source codes owned by companies or
consortia (e.g., CEMI) there was recently a wave of openly released codes.

Results from numerical modellers for simple models, such as a halfspace below
air or a sphere in a fullspace, can be verified by comparing them to analytical
solutions. However, there is no such possibility for complicated, realistic
models. The only way to gain confidence in numerical results is by comparing
different codes to each other. We hope that our efforts help to the confidence
in the available open-source codes...

Also, the runtime and memory consumption comparison together with the meshing
differences should help to decide which modeller is used best for which tasks,
as there is not one method which is best for all problems.

It is important to note that there exist many more 3D electromagnetic codes
from various fields, such as civil engineering or medicine, in Python and in
many other languages (list a few references here). Here we focused on codes in
Python developed for geophysical exploration.
