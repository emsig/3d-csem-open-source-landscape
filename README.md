# Status of the open-source landscape for 3D CSEM modelling

Work in progress...

The current paper is in the `paper`-directory. Build it by running

```bash
make html
```

in the `paper` directory, and subsequently open `paper/_build/html/index.html`
in your browser.

If you have `sphinx-autobuild` installed (`pip install sphinx-autobuild`),
you can type

```bash
make livehtml
```

This will automatically open a browser with the docs, watch the
`paper` directory, re-build whenever a source file has changed, and
refresh the browser.
